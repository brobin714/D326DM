WGU Final Project for Advanced Data Management 


This is a project where a business case for a DVD rental store is created by querying a premade database to create two new tables, creating a function to transform data, and creating a trigger and stored procedure to update them when data is entered into the database.

The business case for this DVD store is to track and compare monthly rentals between their two locations.
